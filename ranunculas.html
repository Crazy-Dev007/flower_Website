  <h1>Ranunculas</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Introduction </h2>
      <li><p>These gorgeous flowers are beloved for their brilliantly colored double-ruffled petals, tall stems, and long vase life. Their color range, from deep pink and apricot to cream and pale yellow, make them a favorite at florist shops and in wedding bouquets.</p></li>
<li><p> ln warmer climates, ranunculus can be planted outdoors in fall with minimal protection. In colder areas where temperatures dip well below freezing for extended periods, wait to plant the tubers in late winter or early spring (once the threat of frost has passed) or start them indoors in pots about eight to 12 weeks before the average last frost.</p></li>

  <br> <h2>How to Grow Ranunculus Flowers  </h2>
 <br> <li> <p> Choose tubers labeled jumbo, which average eight centimeters in circumference, for the most flower stems per bulb. You can expect to see as many as three dozen flowers born on 18-inch stems from these bulbs. Number two and number three bulbs are fine for planting groups of a dozen or more outdoors.</p> </li>
 <br> <li> <p>If you live in zones 8 to 11 and wish to try growing the plants as perennials, leave them in place and allow the foliage to die back naturally at summer’s end. Dormant tubers appreciate dry, cool conditions; too much moisture and warmth will cause rot. </p> </li>
 <br> <li> <p> If you have a large cold frame or small hoop house, you can grow ranunculus bulbs in zones 6 or 7 by providing protection, such as a cool winter greenhouse, when a hard freeze is expected.</p> </li>
 <br> <li> <p>Cut the flowers when they first begin to show color for long-lasting bouquets. </p> </li>
 <h2> Light</h2>
 <br> <li><p> Plant the tubers in full sun with the claw end pointing down, and cover them with an inch of soil. For indoor container plantings, choose a south-facing, sunny window. Both roots and plants emerge from the top of the clump, not from the tips of the claws. </p></li>
 <h2>Soil </h2>
 <br><li><p> If you have heavy soil, amend with peat moss or plant in raised beds. An application of bone meal at planting time is fine, but not necessary for ranunculus tubers treated as annuals.</p></li>
 <h2> Recommend  Varities</h2>
  <br> <h3> Persian Buttercup (Ranunculus asiaticus)</h3>
 <br><ul> <ul> <ul><a href="ranunculas.html"><img src="D:\project html\Flower shop\images\our flowers/persianbuttercup.jpg" alt="" /></a></ul></ul></ul>
 <br> <li><p>Although it is native to Europe and Asia, the Persian buttercup does well in the United States zones 8-10. Starting with a bulb and getting up to 2 feet in height and 2 feet in width, the flower blooms in May and June, and it has poppy-like petals that come in colors such as purple, white, pink, red, and white. The leaves are green and look similar to parsley, and it does well in full sun and soil that is moist but well-drained. They also look beautiful in containers, borders, and flowerbeds. </p></li>
 <br> <h3> Ranunculus (Hanoi) </h3> 
 <br> <li> <p> If cotton candy and marshmallow got married and had a baby flower, the result would be ranunculus 'Hanoi.' Is there any pink more ethereal than these petals? 'Hanoi' ranunculus blooms will be in high demand by brides who desire a bouquet that matches a gently flushed cheek. </p></li>

 <br> <li><p> Italian Ranunculus Cloony also know as Cloni Ranunculus have a large flower and heavy stems with a heavy petal count and originated in Italy. We have some locally California grown. and we import from Italy when needed. </p></li>
 <br> <li><p> The stems cost more than regular ranunculus varieties because the bulb/ corm is a lot higher priced plus in order to get the size flower a grower has to pinch back the flowers. This means a lower yield per corm. Blush Italian Clooni Ranunculus are great for bouquets and vase arrangements. They have an excellent vase life and the season is from December / January until April / May depending on the  weather. Please reserve or order at least 7 workdays in advance. Stems are 15- 25 ‘ tall  and 10 stems per bunch</p></li>
 <br> <h3>Ranunculus (Tango) </h3>
 <br> <li><p> A cluster of sultry 'Tango' Ranunculus blooms can knock red roses off their pedestal as a gift for a loved one. The layers of ruby petals beg to be touched, and Ranunculus flowers are much easier to grow without the use of pesticides than roses. </p></li>
 <br> <li> <p> Red ranunculus is a gorgeous flower that has a vibrant color. The petal filled blooms provide a bright pop of red color in bouquets and centerpieces or use them alone to create simple and beautiful arrangements</p></li>

 <h3>Ranunculus (Purple Picotee)  </h3>
 <br> <li> <p> Ranunculus 'Purple Picotee' is a florist's delight, creating a lavish display when combined with peonies, larkspur, or lisianthus blossoms. Grow the bulbs as annuals in the cutting garden, giving them plenty of moisture and very good drainage. </p> </li>

 <br> <li> <p>Medieval kings and queens chose this color as their own; it's clear why. This shade is undeniably regal, with a depth reminiscent of luxurious velvet robes. Most of us won't ever own a castle, but for aspiring nobility here is an affordable bit of easy opulence. </p> </li>
  <br> <li> <p> This purple shade is dynamite when combined with orange! Mix some purples with pastel ranunculus for a softer, equally gorgeous look.</p> </li>
 <br> <li> <p> Grown at the famous Carlsbad Flower Fields, these ranunculus bulbs are hardy outdoors in zones 8-11 (for fall planting) but are more than welcome in gardens of cooler regions.</p> </li> <br>
