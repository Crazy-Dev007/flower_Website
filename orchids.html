	<br> <h3>About Caring for Your Orchid in Bloom </h3>
     <p>When you first get your orchid, it will likely be in bloom. Obviously, you want to prolong the bloom as long as possible, so whatever the tag says, here are a few tips that can help. </p> 
     <br>
	 <p> First, most gift orchids are potted in the wrong conditions for long-term growth. They are potted in plastic and packed with moss around the roots. In nature, orchids typically grow on trees, and their roots are water-gathering organs that need loads of fresh air flow to be healthy.</p> 
	 <br>
	 <p> Orchids with wet roots are susceptible to root rot and other problems. While the current container may not be ideal, you never want to repot a blooming orchid. It's too stressful on the plant, and it will drop its blooms.</p> 
	<br>
	 <h2> Planting </h2>
	 <br> 
	 <h3>When to Plant Lilies </h3>
	 <br>
	 <li><p> Plant lily bulbs in the fall, a few weeks before the winter brings freezing temperatures. Bulbs planted in the autumn will have well established roots in the spring. The bulbs benefit from a winter chill to produce big blooms.</p></li>
	<br>
	<li> <p>We do advise planting in spring in areas with particularly harsh winters. Container-grown lily plants can be planted anytime during the summer. </p> </li>
	<br>
	<li> <p>Buy the bulbs close to planting time. You don’t want to buy the bulbs in the fall and wait until spring to plant them. </p> </li>
	<br>
	<h3>  How to Plant Lilies</h3>
	<br>
	<li> <p> Select a site with soil that drains well. How can you tell? After a good rain, find a spot that is the first to dry out. Water trapped beneath the overlapping scales on the lily bulb may cause rot, so a well-drained site is essential. </p> </li>
	<br> 
	<li> <p> Lilies need lots of sun. For dependable blooms, lilies need 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight a day. If it’s too shady, the stems will attempt to lean towards the sun or get spindly and fall over.</p> </li>
	<br>
	<li> <p> Lilies are best suited for Zones 3 to 8. They do not thrive in Zones 9 and 10 without a period of refrigeration; they need a cold, dormant period. </p> </li>
	<br> <li> <p>Loosen the soil to a depth of 12 to 15 inches. The deep planting encourages the developing stem to send out roots to help stabilize the plant and perhaps eliminate the need for staking. Also, deep planting keeps lily bulbs cool when temperatures soar. </p> </li>
	<br>
	<h3>How to Care for Lilies </h3>
	<br>
	<li> <p> During active growth, water freely—especially if rainfall is less than 1 inch per week.</p> </li>
	<br> <li> <p>Apply a high-potassium liquid fertilizer every 2 weeks from planting until 6 weeks after flowering.
Apply a thin layer of compost each spring, followed by a 2-inch layer of mulch. </p> </li>
	<br> <li> <p>After the lily blooms, you can also remove just the stem itself. However, do NOT remove leaves until they have died down and turned brown in fall. It’s very important not to cut back the leaves until the end of their season because hey help provide nourishment to the bulb for next season’s blooms. </p> </li>
	<h2> Recommend Varities</h2>
	<br>
	<h3> Matrix Lily </h3>
	<br>
	<p>The intensely colored flowers of Asiatic lily Matrix are mesmerizing. With a high bud count of up to seven flowers per stem, you only need a few bulbs to create a focal point in the early summer landscape. The petite 20-inch stalks of Matrix lilies are just right for the container garden.  </p>

	<br>
	<h3> Luxor Lily </h3>
	<br>
	<p> The gold and bronze tones of the Luxor Asiatic lily will make a splash in your summer garden, especially when planted with orange companion plants like cosmos or butterfly weed. Hybrid lilies like Luxor do not come true from seed, so propagate them by taking offsets or scales by lifting the bulbs and peeling away baby bulblets.</p>

	<br>
	<h3> Stargazer Lily </h3>
	<br>
	<p> Today's gardeners are spoiled by the vast number of lilies with upward-facing flowers, but that was not a given in the 1970s. When breeder Leslie Woodriff developed the first Oriental lily to feature flowers that faced the heavens, the Stargazer cultivar took the gardening (and florist) world by storm. Hardy in zones 4 to 9, this 3-foot stunner will perfume your entire</p>

	<br>
	<h3> Asiatc Lily </h3>
	<br>
	<p> Asiatic lilies, like the 'Lollypop' cultivar featured in this photo, are arguably the easiest lilies to grow for beginning flower gardeners. The flowers are mostly unscented, but we'll forgive them that fault for the ​rainbow of luscious colors available. Flowers may face up, down, or outwards, and usually bloom in June or July. Although lilies aren't common in container gardens, dwarf Asiatics like the 12-inch tall 'Buff Pixie' will adapt to pot culture. </p>

	<br>
	<h3>  Candidum Hybrid Lilies</h3>
	<br>
	<p>  A true heirloom plant, the Madonna lily has been cultivated for thousands of years. Candidum hybrid lilies need a sheltered spot; an eastern exposure with morning sun is preferred. Amend the soil if needed to bring the pH to a neutral level, and plant the bulbs just under the soil's surface, about one inch deep. Plants prefer slightly dry conditions, and will succumb to grey mold in damp locations. Trumpet-shaped white blooms appear in summer on stalks that can grow up to six feet tall, a stunning and unusual lily for collectors.</p>
	<ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <a href="lilies.html"><img src="D:\project html\Flower shop\images\our flowers/candidumlili.jpg" alt="" /></a></ul> </ul> </ul> </ul> </ul>
	<br>
	<h3> Longiflorum Hybrid Lilies </h3>
	<br>
	<p> The longiflorum lily division is familiar to most gardeners as the seasonal Easter lily, forced by growers to bloom in the spring. In the garden, longiflorum lilies produce their white, trumpet-shaped blooms in July or August. Unlike many seasonal gift plants, you can successfully move the Easter lily to a permanent spot outside. To grow outdoors, choose a sheltered spot where ideally the flowers will be in the sun, but the roots will be in the shade. Leave foliage intact, and provide regular moisture. </p>

	<br>
	<h3> Trumpet lilies </h3>
	<br>
	<p>  Everyone should experience the pomp and circumstance of a trumpet lily at least once in a lifetime. Aurelians are trumpet hybrids that are easy to grow, as long as you stake them to protect their massive blooms and give them a layer of insulating mulch to help them through the winter. Trumpet lilies like this 'Golden Sunburst' variety are more drought tolerant than other lilies but may exceed heights of eight feet with a little TLC.  </p>

	<h2>Decoration </h2>
	<br>
	<p>To arrange these delicate blooms I began with a few leaves. They act as sort of a stabilizer and add a great pop of green. I then added the blooms in small bunches until I had filled each container. </p>
	<br>
	<p> Lilies of the Valley take no real care. Plant them in part-shade and let them go. I know some people think they are too invasive but if you have an empty spot they are the perfect choice. It takes a few years to get blooms so be patient. Let the foliage die down and cut them back in the fall. Like other hardy perennials, they need the foliage to die down completely to feed the plant for the next season.</p>
	<ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <a href="lilies.html"><img src="D:\project html\Flower shop\images\our flowers/decorlili.jpg" alt="" /></a></ul> </ul> </ul> </ul> </ul>
	<p>It’s important to know also that Lilies of the Valley are poisonous. Take extra care to wash your hands after handling and wash your containers well when the flowers are spent.

I have never once looked at my patch of Lilies of the Valley and not thought of Charlene. Then when I think of her, I think of my old job and the school that I love. I miss it and miss the people. There are days when I would give anything to be back at my old desk…but I embraced this blogging adventure and the adventure isn’t over. Thanks to all of you, it’s just beginning. </p>
