    <h1>Gerbera</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The stems grow from a basal clump of dark-green leathery leaves to about 18 inches, or sometime even 30 inches, in height. The blooms are four inches across and resemble large daisies. They come in red, orange, yellow, pink, white and cream colours and can continue flowering for six months.</p>

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
        <p>Gerbera are native to South Africa and are also found in the wild in Madagascar and Asia. They grow on grasslands, rocky slopes, the veldt and in sandy soils. They thrive in full sun or partial shade in tropical, subtropical and temperate climates and are very tolerant of infertile soils but do not like temperatures below about 7 degrees C.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>While Gerbera come in a variety of shapes, there are four main groups: single flowers with a row of non-overlapping petals and a green centre; double or duplex with a double row of overlapping petals with a green, black, or dark red eye; crested doubles containing two rows of overlapping petals with one or more inner rows of shorter petals with a green, black, or dark red eye and full crested doubles which have solid overlapping rows of petals with an inner row reducing in size and covering the eye entirely.</p>
      </li>
	  <li>
        <h3>Care Tips</h3>
        <p>Gerbera needs a well-drained soil in a sunny spot in the garden. It responds well to a standard fertiliser. Prolong the blooms outdoors by dead-heading.
In pots indoors, it is best grown in an equal mixture of peat, compost and sand. It is prone to aphids, so use a pesticide outdoors and indoors and wash the leaves with mild soapy water once a month to keep pests away.

	  <h3>About Gerbera Flower </h3>
	  <p> Gerberas are perennial flowering plants featuring a large capitulum with striking, 2-lipped ray florets. The capitulum on the Gerberas has the appearance of a single flower, but is actually a cluster of hundreds of individual flowers. The morphology of the flowers varies depending on their position in the capitulum of the Gerberas.</p>

	  <h3>Growing Gerberas </h3>
	  <p> The most inexpensive way to produce gerberas is from seed obtained from reputable seed suppliers.
Seeds should be germinated in an artificial growing medium. Germinating seeds in field sand or field sand mixed with materials such as perlite and/or peat moss is not recommended because field sand is usually not sterile. Artificial growing media that are sterile, lightweight, and have good water retention capacity and drainage can be purchased in garden supply stores. These materials often have fertilizers incorporated.</p>
