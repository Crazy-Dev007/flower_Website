    <h1>Tulips</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>Tulips are the most colorful of all spring flowers. They are also one of the easiest flowers you'll ever grow. Just plant the bulbs in fall for blossoms the following spring. </h3>
      <p>There are hundreds of beautiful tulips to choose from, in enough colors, shapes, sizes and bloom times to inspire every gardenerâ€™s creativity. 
 
</p>
 
      <p>Whether you plant them in groups of 10 or 1000, tulips always put on an impressive show. </p>
    </div>
	</ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>START WITH A BETTER BULB</h3>
        <p>When you compare two tulip bulbs side by side, it's easy to see differences in quality. Larger bulbs (as shown at far left) contain more stored food energy and will produce stronger stems and bigger blooms. Healthy tulip bulbs should feel firm (not dry or mushy). A small amount of surface mold is normal.</p>
        <p>Tulip bulbs are measured in centimeters around the "waist" of the bulb. Longfield Gardens supplies tulip bulbs that are at least 12cm in circumference. This ensures you will always get the biggest, brightest blooms. </p>
	  </li>
      <li>
        <h3>PLAN FOR SUCCESS</h3>
        <p>Sun and Shade: Tulips are remarkably versatile and will grow in sun, part sun or shade.</p>
		<p> Hardiness Zone: Tulips are hardy in growing zones 3-8. Reference the USDA Hardiness Zone Map.</p>
		<p>  Soil Conditions: Tulips should be planted in good soil that is well-drained and never soggy. Peat moss or compost may be added to help improve drainage.</p>
        <p>Cut Flower Gardens: Enjoy the fun of arranging bouquets of tulips for your home or to share with friends. Planting tulip bulbs in a cutting garden makes it easy to bring the freshness of spring indoors.
	</p>
	   <p> Curb Appeal: Tulips look great in mass plantings and will attract the admiring eyes of everyone who passes by. The more tulips you plant, the better the show.</p>
       <p> Containers and Windowboxes: In the fall, you can replace summer annuals with tulip bulbs. Greigii tulips and double early tulips are especially good for containers. The bulbs will sleep through the winter months and deliver a burst of spring color long before you're ready to begin planting. In growing zones 6-8, the planters may be left outdoors for the winter. In colder areas they will need to be protected from extreme cold.

        <h3>WHERE TO PLANT TULIPS</h3>
        <p>Entryways and Borders: Tulips will fill your yard with color long before most other plants have emerged from their winter sleep. Create a warm welcome by planting a bed of tulips along your front walk or in front yard flower beds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>HOW TO PLANT TULIPS</h3>
        <p>When to Plant: Tulip bulbs should be planted in mid to late fall, any time after the first frost and before the ground freezes. For best results, plant the bulbs within a month after you receive them.</p>
        <p>Depth and Spacing: Plant tulip bulbs 6" to 8" deep and 4" to 5" apart on center. You may plant the bulbs individually, or can dig out a larger area and plant a number of bulbs at once. Position the bulbs with the pointy end up and then cover them with soil. Fall and winter rains usually provide adequate moisture. Water only if the weather is very dry. </p>
	    <p> Planting Tips: Planting tulips side by side in a single row looks stiff and unnatural. For best results, plant informal groups of 7 or more bulbs. Rectangular, triangular or oval patterns will make the planting look as full as possible and ensure the flowers are visible from all angles.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
        <h3>Flower Care Tips</h3>
        <p>Once you have mastered how to arrange flowers, it will be important to take proper care of your fresh bouquets. There is nothing like a bouquet that lasts and lasts and lasts. </p>
        <p>
    Once your flowers have been arranged, expect them to bloom within three days.
    After the third day, change the water in your vase and add your second packet of flower food.

	<h3>The Life Cycle of Tulips - Mesmerizing, Cup-shaped Flowers </h3> 
	<p> 
Tulips Life Cycle
Tulips are bright, cup-shaped flowers with a smooth green stem. These belong to the Liliaceae family. The countries of Central and West Asia experience hot and dry summers and very cold winters, and tulips have developed special methods to survive the extreme climatic conditions by remaining dormant during the harsh winter. They bloom during the spring and summer months. Tulips have underground storage organs called bulbs to survive the long months of winter. The following sections describe the stages of growth of this plant:
</p>
<p> 
First Stage
The tulip bulbs are planted from mid-September to mid-November. During this period, the soil is moist. This fosters the growth of the bulb under the ground. In the first cycle of growth, the roots start growing from the bulb to form a strong root system. If you have planted the bulbs in the month of October, you can expect a strong root system by December.
</p>
<p>
Second Stage
When the snow-covered soil begins to thaw towards the end of winter, you can see a healthy green shoot coming out from a tulip bulb. By early or mid April, the tulips would start to bloom. The flowering season continues till mid-May. During the flowering season, the leaves of the tulips develop.
 </p>
 <p> 
Third/Final Stage
The foliage plays an important role in the life cycle of tulips. The leaves should never be cut, as they are responsible for the process of photosynthesis. The food derived from solar energy is stored in the form of carbohydrate in the bulbs. This food is required for the growth and the flowering process of tulips in the following year. Gradually, the leaves turn yellow and wither away. Thereafter, the bulbs enter a state of dormancy after completing the yearly cycle.
