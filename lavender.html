    <h1>Lavenders</h1>
	<br> <h3> About Lavenders</h3>
    <li> <p>At her farm in Silverton, Oregon, Trina Riemersma grows the varieties listed below. All thrive in full sun and well-drained soil (add organic matter to improve heavy soils). </p> </li>
    <li> <p> English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) Sunset climate zones 2-24. A sweetly fragrant lavender used for perfume and sachets; also good for flavoring ice cream, jams, meat rubs, and pastries.</p> </li>
	<li> <p> Riemersma finds her ‘Buena Vista’ lavender ― with fragrant, dark blue-purple flowers ― the perfect complement to savory dishes and sweet desserts ( Lavandula angustifolia ‘Mun-stead’ and ‘Hidcote’ can also flavor food). She uses it to enhance blackberry jam and shortbread cookies and as a rub (along with rosemary) for cedar-planked salmon with lavender-honey glaze. For the recipe, see her website.</p> </li>
	<br> 
	<br>
	<p>Most varieties form mounds of foliage up to 2 feet tall. Unbranched stems rise above gray-green or silvery foliage; flowers are white, pink, lavender-blue, or various shades of purple. </p>
	<br> <p>Lavandin (L. x intermedia) Zones 4-24. Branching stems with flowers that appear at intervals near top.</p></br>
	<p>‘Grosso’ is a widely planted commercial variety in France and Italy; possibly the most fragrant lavandin of all. Compact growth to 2½ ft. tall and wide. Silvery foliage; large, conical spikes of violet-blue flowers with darker calyxes. Often repeats bloom in late summer. Excellent for drying. </p>
	<br>
	<p> Although ‘Provence’ is often described as the perfume lavender, this selection doesn’t produce the kind of oil used in perfumery. Grows 2 ft. tall, with fragrant violet-blue flowers that dry well. Good hedge plant.</p>

	<h2>Lavender Care </h2>
	<br> <p> Plant lavender in full sun and well-drained soil (add organic matter to improve heavy soils).
Water plants deeply but infrequently, when the soil is almost dry.</p>
	<br> <p> Prune in early spring or at harvest time. For low-growing varieties, trim back foliage 1 to 2 inches. Starting in a plant’s second year, all 3- to 4-foot lavenders should be cut back by about a third to keep the plant from getting overly woody. If a plant becomes woody and open in the center, remove a few of the oldest branches; take out more when new growth starts. If this doesn’t work, it’s time to dig out the plant and replace it. (Some commercial growers replace plants after 10 to 12 years.)</p>
	<br> <p> Harvest for sachets and potpourri by cutting flower spikes or stripping flowers from stems just as blossoms show color; dry in a cool, shaded place.</p>

	<h2>'Purple Bouquet' English Lavender  </h2>
	<p> With long stems, silvery-green foliage, and flower heads packed with rich purple blooms in early summer, 'Purple Bouquet' is a top choice if you want to grow lavender for cutting fresh or drying.</p>
	<p>Its relatively compact size, 20”tall, 24-30”wide makes it a bit easier to place in gardens than typical English lavender, but with the same culinary uses. Easy to grow with good drainage, lavenders are deer resistant, heat and drought tolerant plants.  </p>

	<br> <p>Bring some charm to your garden with the reblooming flower power of pincushion flower. Plant it in groups of three or five for the greatest impact. </p>
	<p>These long-blooming perennials—and in some cases, annuals—have long been prized for their old-fashioned charm and versatility. They get their name from their interesting flowers that resemble little pincushions. </p>

	<h2>  Decoration</h2>
	<br> <p> 1.Once harvested, avoid packing stems tightly in vases, which will allow them to dry naturally. Lavender flowers remain fragrant and attractive, and may be kept on display for extended periods of time </p>
	<br> <p> 2.although they may be a bit messy as they drop fine dried petals over time. Lavender flower are traditionally dried in tied bunches hanging upside down in a cool, dark, dry place. Store away from light, heat, and humidity.</p>
	<br> <p> 3.When the plants are completely dry, you can either keep the stalks on and use them in flower arrangements, or rub the flower buds free of the stalks and add them to your potpourri or to make lavender bags which can be used inside drawers to make your clothes smell fresh. </p>
	<br> <p> 4.A good choice of lavender for harvesting is Lavandula angustifolia ‘Imperial gem’, which is highly decorative as well as aromatic and ideal for planting near a path at the front of the border.</p>
