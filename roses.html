    <h1>Roses</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Introduction </h2>
      <p>The rose is a woody perennial that was originally from China but is now grown across the world. It is characterised by wide range of colours and sizes.The rose has been used as a symbol of love for hundreds of years.
 
</p>
<p> Roses are multi-petal flowers available in an array of colours. Some varieties are known for their prickles along the stems of the plant, which are used to deter predators. Many species are now cultivated although there are still varieties that grow in the wild.</p>
 </div></ul>
 <ul>
 
        <h2>Description and use</h2>
		<li>
        <p>The flower of the rose plant can be different sizes. It may be as small as 1/2 inch across to a diameter of almost 7 inches. Also, roses can be used for good scent. The scent of the rose comes from tiny perfume glands on the petals, which can be seen through a powerful microscope. Sometimes rose petals are dried and packed so that you can use them for decoration or for scent</p>
        <p>Roses can be seen very much in gardens. Sometimes they can be in vineyards as well. In a big vineyard, a bush of roses are planted at the end of each row of vines. As long as the roses stay healthy, the vine growers can see that their vines are healthy as well. </p>
	  </li>
	  
        <h2>Garden roses</h2>
		<li>
        <p>There are thousands of rose cultivars that people grow in gardens and on farms. The names used to describe the different types often refer to one species that is the main ancestor of that group, for example, Gallica roses are mostly descended from Rosa gallica. Other groups have several different species among their ancestors. Hybrid Tea roses, Floribunda roses, and English roses are the most common in gardens today. They are of so many colours like red, yellow, orange, pink, purple and so on </p>

	 </li>
	 
	 <h2> Habitat</h2>
	 <li>
	 <p> Roses are native to China but are now grown across the world and thrive in sunny, well-drained soil. They particularly like clay soils and it is best to grow roses away from other plants so their roots are not disturbed. It is important to remember that hybridized flowers such as roses have become more adaptable to different conditions so check when buying your roses what the optimum conditions are.</p>
	 </li>
	 <h2> Availability</h2>
	 <li>
	 <p>When growing in the garden, roses should be planted between November and February. Roses are available all year round and are sold either as seeds or as cuttings. If you are growing in a pot, they can be planted at any time. </p>
	 </li> 
	 <h2> Care Tips</h2>
	 <li>
	 <p> Roses need to be fed regularly and the amount of feeding will depend on the kind of soil they are planted in. Pruning is also important and should be done after between mid-February and mid-March during a sustained frost-free period.</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Watering Roses</h3>
	 </li>
	 <li> 
	 <p> Diligently water your roses. Soak the entire root zone at least twice a week in dry summer weather. Avoid frequent shallow sprinklings, which won’t reach the deeper roots and may encourage fungus. In the fall reduce the amount of water, but do not allow roses to completely dry out.
 </p>
	 </li>
	 <li> 
	 <p> Roses love water—but don’t drown them. That is, they don’t like to sit in water, and they’ll die if the soil is too wet in winter. The ideal soil is rich and loose, with good drainage. One of the worst mistakes you can make is to not provide adequate drainage.</p>
	 </li>
	 <li>
	 <p> Use mulch. To help conserve water, reduce stress, and encourage healthy growth, apply a 2- to 4-inch layer of chopped and shredded leaves, grass clippings, or shredded bark around the base of your roses. Allow about 1 inch of space between the mulch and the base stem of the plant. See our Mulching Guide for more information.</p>

	 <h2> How to Decorate with Roses, According to a Pro </h2>
	 
	  <li>
	  <p> Roses are some of the prettiest, most recognizable flowers around—and you can make them part of your home every day of the year with these simple tips.Valentine’s Day may be the day of a dozen roses, but a true rose aficionado will want to find out how to keep cut roses fresh so those gorgeous blooms can stay around for as long as possible. Keeping fresh flowers around the house can boost moods and give the whole space a positive feel, and learning how to arrange roses in a vase (or any kind of flower in a vase) is a great life-skill you can show off every time you host.</p>
	 </li>
	 <h3> 1.Pick the right color: </h3>
	 <p> Red is the standard when it comes to roses, but these flowers can come in a huge variety of hues. If you’re planning on keeping them around, pick a color that fits into that of the room, especially if you want the roses to feel like part of the space. If you want a contrasting pop of color, go with something bold and bright, like the classic red.</p>
	 <h3>2.Size the arrangement accordingly: </h3>
	 <p>Pick a rose arrangement—whether it’s a box or a vase of blooms—that is sized proportionately with its surroundings, just like you would with a lamp or a small figurine. On a small table, the flowers should be mid-height with medium or small blooms; on an expansive coffee table or long bookshelf, larger and taller blooms are appropriate. Just make sure the roses look like they belong there, not like they do not fit into the dimensions of the space. </p>
	 <h3>3.Make it part of a larger arrangement: </h3>
	 <p>Dadush suggests arranging small, artful items such as books and candles around the flower arrangement so it’s naturally included into the space. By placing smaller (or some larger) items around the roses, they’ll look more incorporated into the space, rather than just placed in a pre-existing one. </p>
	 <h3>4.Accessorize it right: </h3> 
	 <p> The vase—or box, with long-lasting arrangements like those from Rose Box—should feel as part of the décor as the roses. Pick a color, size, and shape that suits its surroundings and feels equally decorative to the roses, rather than a background for them</p>
	 <h3>5.Space the arrangement out</h3>
	 <p>If a large collection of roses might seem too large or bold for the space, consider spacing smaller arrangements—or even single stems on their own—around the room for a simple, understated look. Each stem will feel like a small surprise, and dispersing the blooms can help downplay the elegance roses carry with them. </p>

	 <h2>Recommend Varities </h2>
	 <p> Traditionally, roses were notoriously challenging to grow. However, roses have changed. There are now many modern easy-to-grow types of roses available. Here are some of our favorites:</p>
	 <h3>Pink Roses </h3>
	 <p> such as ‘Carefree Wonder’ are well-rounded shrub roses cold hardy to Zone 5. They grow about 3 feet tall and require only a little shaping in early spring.</p>
	 <br><ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul><a href="#"><img src="D:\project html\Flower shop\images\our flowers/pinkrose.jpg" alt="" /></a></ul></ul> </ul></ul></ul></ul>
	<br> <li> <p>With all of the above in mind, the pink rose makes a great gift and a fantastic flower to grow.Of course, it is important to look after such a floral arrangement if you wish to prolong its lifespan. Firstly, you must choose a fresh bouquet from a trustworthy supplier </p></li>
	<br> <li> <p>To display, trim the stems, cutting any foliage below the water line, add the recommended amount of water and plant food to a vase (warm water is preferable) and place the flowers in a bright, well-lit space. </p> </li> 
	<br> <h3>Red Roses </h3>
	 <p> raditionally, the rose is considered the flower of love, which is why red roses are popular Valentine’s Day gifts. The hue and variant convey deep emotions, including that of longing, love, and desire. Red roses are often also used to express feelings of admiration, respect, and devotion.</p>
	 <br><ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <a href="#"><img src="D:\project html\Flower shop\images\our flowers/redrose (2).jpg" alt="" /></a></ul></ul> </ul></ul></ul></ul>
	 <br> <li> <p>As well as the color, the number of roses that is gifted also portrays a specific meaning. A dozen roses are the most prevalent quantity to give and are associated with the messages ‘I love you’ and ‘be mine’. </p> </li>
	 <br> <li> <p>Sending roses to a loved one on Valentine’s Day is a time-honored tradition. Not all roses, however, are the same! These elegant, yet fragile flowers, require the correct care in order to stand the test of time. This is why sending roses using a service that offers same-day delivery is a great idea! It means the roses will arrive in tip-top condition in the shape of a bouquet that is as fresh as it can be. </p> </li>
	 <h3> Yellow Roses</h3>
	 <p> While in Victorian times, the yellow rose symbolised jealousy, today it represents friendship, joy, and caring. A bouquet of these sun-filled blossoms conveys warmth, gladness, and affection.</p>
	 <br><ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul><a href="#"><img src="D:\project html\Flower shop\images\our flowers/yellowrose.jpg" alt="" /></a></ul></ul> </ul></ul></ul></ul>
	 <br> <li> <p> These beautiful sun colored roses can also convey warmth, delight, gladness and affection, as well as say good luck, welcome back, and remember me. The yellow rose is the perfect rose for a close friend or someone who needs a little cheering up since these blooms are sure to brighten anyone’s day!  </p> </li>
	 <h3> White Roses </h3>
	 <p>The ivory rose, although similar to white roses, have a totally different meaning. They are said to represent charm, thoughtfulness and gracefulness. Ivory colored roses also represent richness and perfection. Ivory roses would be great for letting someone know you care, without romantic intentions.  </p> 
	 <br><ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul><a href="#"><img src="D:\project html\Flower shop\images\our flowers/whiterose.jpg" alt="" /></a></ul></ul> </ul></ul></ul></ul>
	 <br> <li> <p> White roses are sometimes referred to as bridal roses because of their association with young love and eternal loyalty. White roses can also symbolize a new beginning and everlasting love. </p> </li>
	 <br> <li> <p>Representing, humility, purity, and innocence, the white rose – often referred to as the bridal rose – is associated with young love. In Scotland, when the white rose bloomed in autumn, it was seen as a token of early marriage. Also symbolising truth and reverence, it sends a message of loyalty and says ‘I am worthy of you.’ </p> </li>
	 <h3> Orange Roses</h3>
	 <p> With their warm, vibrant tones, orange roses symbolise enthusiasm and desire. If you’re looking for a way to express admiration and attraction – with an underlying message of passion and excitement – then send a bouquet filled with these fiery blooms</p>
	 <br><ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul> <ul><a href="#"><img src="D:\project html\Flower shop\images\our flowers/orangerose.jpg" alt="" /></a></ul></ul> </ul></ul></ul></ul>
	 <br> <li> <p>This bold and fiery bloom often stands for desire, fascination, enthusiasm and energy. The orange rose can say “I am so proud of you” with their meaning of admiration and excitement.

	 <h3> Peach Roses</h3>
	 <p> The sweet peach rose conveys a meaning of modesty, genuineness, sincerity and gratitude. It can be great for saying “thank you” and would be an appropriate gift when closing a business deal, for example. The peach rose can also be a great way to show sympathy to a loved one or a close friend. </p>
