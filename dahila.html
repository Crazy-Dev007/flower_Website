    <h1>Dahila</h1>
	<br> <h3>About Dahila</h3>
     <p>Dahlias are mid- to late season flowers that come in a vast array of colors and forms. There are small flowered bedding dahlias as well as plate-sized blossoms on 6 ft. plants. It's hard to give an overview of dahlias when there is so much diversity.</p> 
     <br>
	 <p> Dahlias are often grown for their long-lasting cut flowers. There are some 30 species of dahlias and over 20,000 cultivars. Native to Central America, they have become darlings of plant breeders and flower shows and every year they become more dazzling.</p> 
	 <br>
	 <p> Most of us think of dahlias as cut flowers. They do make exceptional cut flowers, but they also deserve some recognition as garden plants. Although they can be a little temperamental and fussy about the weather and growing conditions, many of the newer cultivars have been bred to be more reliable and easy growing.</p> 
	<br>
	 <h2>Hardiness Zone </h2>
	 <br> 
	 <h3> USDA Hardiness Zones </h3>
	 <br>
	 <p>Hardiness depends on the cultivar, but most are only reliably hardy in USDA Hardiness Zones 8 - 11. Most gardeners grow them as tender bulbs or annuals. </p>
	 <br> <p> When asked if there was an ideal climate for dahlias and should gardeners in different zones choose different varieties, Hans said that although they are native to the hot climate of Mexico and Central America, they will grow just about anywhere. In fact, hot climates can be a challenge because the dahlias will need extra water.</p>
	 <br>
	 <h2>Sun Exposure </h2>
	 <br>
	 <p> </p> 
	 <br> <p>To flower well, dahlias need full sun, preferably at least 8 hours. In hotter climates, (Zones 8 and up) they will do better with some afternoon shade. </p>

<br> <h2>Design Suggestions </h2>
<br>
<p>Since dahlias need room to spread out, it can be difficult to pair them with other plants. However, they do tend to get gangly legs and having some camouflage at their base is not a bad idea. A good place to tuck in dahlias is near the fading foliage of spring bulbs, like daffodils and tulips. The dahlias should sprout just when you need a distraction from the fading spring bloomers, but still be short enough to allow the spring bulbs to get the sunshine they need. </p>
<br> <p>Hans also encouraged growing dahlias in containers. They grow well in pots and you can get them started earlier than in the ground. He recommends 2 - 3 plants in a container that's at least 15-20 inches in diameter. </p>
